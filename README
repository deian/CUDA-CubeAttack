This is an implementation of a CUDA CubeAttack framework. The code is
copied from my old Master's thesis svn repo (so certain things might
be missing -- if you find that this is the case, please let me know).
at the request of a few students working on a similar topic.
See the thesis for high-level details of the implementation.


The implementation includes an CUDA implementations of the XSR
random number generator, and the Trivium and MICKEY strem ciphers.
See the gSTREM repo for implementation of other eSTREAM ciphers.
