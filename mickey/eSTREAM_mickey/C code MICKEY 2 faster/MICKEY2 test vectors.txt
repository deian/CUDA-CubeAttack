This text file, containing data generated by the software in this directory, gives examples of key
material and corresponding keystream.  Each key value k_0 ... k_79, IV value iv_0 ... iv_(IVLENGTH-1)
or keystream sequence z_0 ... z_127 is represented below by a sequence of bytes, where successive
bytes represent successive groups of 8 bits taken in order of decreasing significance within the byte 
(so bit 0 of the sequence is the msb of the first byte displayed here).

The first three test examples are self explanatory; for details of the fourth please refer to the code
in test_kg.c.
